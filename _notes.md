# Notes

## Goal

Generate a Microsoft Learn module boilerplate structure with user input and sensible defaults using VS Code rather than command-line like Yeoman (currently: [generator-learn-module](https://github.com/patridge/learn-module-generator)).

## Next

* ~~Figure out why VS Code accepts inputs when changing focus (or doing just about anything)~~ `ignoreFocusOut`!
* More error handling
* More denodifying

## Future

* Pull multiple-choice fields from updating data source (with local cache)
* Save GitHub and Microsoft IDs after first use for later defaults
* Modify existing YAML/Markdown files instead of creating TODO files (e.g., achievements.yml or index.yml)
